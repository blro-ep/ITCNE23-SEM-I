## 01 Introduction IAC

**What is IaC?**

> mature technology used by DevOps teams to automate resource provisioning on the cloud

**What is**![AWS CloudFormation](images/cloudformation_logo.png)
 
> Amazon provides its own IaC platform called CloudFormation, it provisions and configures resources based on a template you create, which specifies the resources you require (such as EC2 instances or RDS DB instances, ...)

**What format is the code in?**

> The template you use in CloudFormation template will be a text file in JSON or YAML format 

**What is the project's main mission?**

```
- Automate Infrastructure Provisionen with Cloudformation.
- Deploy a highly available architecture with a reliable 3-tier infrastructure that spans two availability zones.
- Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
- Dedicated custom network access control lists (ACLs) for each Availability Zone.
- A single routing table for the public subnet, because the public subnets all use the same Internet gateway as the only route to communicate with the Internet.
- Dedicated custom network ACLs for each Availability Zone
- An independent routing table for each private subnet configured to control the flow of traffic within and outside the VPC.
- Spare capacity for adding subnets to support your environment as it grows.
- a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). This endpoint provides a secure, reliable connection to Amazon S3
- A layered architecture organizes stacks into multiple horizontal layers that build on top of one another. 
- Include various basic AWS infrastructure services such as SSM / Endpoints / NAT Gateway / Security Groups / NACL / Flow Log / EFS / EC2 / Load Balancer / S3 Bucket
- Built according to AWS best practices and the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
- Build flexible CloudFormation templates with detailed code comments and a cheat sheet to explain the CloudFormation code used.
- Integrate Roger's monitoring solution into my AWS infrastructure and provision various services for monitoring.
- Use a version control system such as CodeCommit or GitHub to track changes to templates.

> while following the best practices outlined in the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

**What is the secondary mission of the project?**

> By providing an accessible platform, this project will enable individuals to gain valuable experience in CloudFormation scripting, as well as an understanding of > the fundamentals and possibility's of CloudFormation.

> This project aims to demonstrate multiple approaches for connecting different CloudFormation scripts together and the implementation will be extensively explained > and commented on to make each step easy to understand. 


## 02 AWS CloudFormation Cheat Sheet

This AWS CloudFormation Cheat Sheet is a quick, self-made reference guide that will provide you with a complete list of all the features that are used in my script.

- [**Full Cheat Sheet**](Cheat_Sheet_Cloud_Formation.md)

![Short Table Version](images/cheat_logo.png)  

- [**Short Cheat Sheet PDF**](cheatsheet_aws-cloudformation.pdf)

For keeping the scop of this project reasonable, the guide is described just in YAML and with man practical examples from the Template, it's designed to help you to understand the fundamentals and the possibility's of CloudFormation.
## 03 Project Overview 

Here is an overview of the AWS infrastructure that will be deployed for the project

## 04 How to Deploy 

Here i will describe how the Template can be deployed via AWS CLI

## 05 AWS Well Architected Framework 

By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems in the cloud.

> The AWS Well-Architected Framework describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud.
