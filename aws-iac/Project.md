Infrastructure as code (IaC)

 mature technology used by DevOps teams to automate resource provisioning on the cloud

 Amazon provides its own IaC platform called CloudFormation

 CloudFormation provisions and configures resources based on a template you create, which specifies the resources you require (such as EC2 instances or RDS DB instances)

 The template you use in CloudFormation template will be a text file in JSON or YAML format 

The project is about gain hands-on experience with YAML scripting creating an AWS CloudFormation template to automate a small environment with a Variety of AWS services such as 
Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS instances, Amazon S3 buckets, and Amazon CloudFront distributions, while following the best practices outlined in the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

By providing an accessible platform, this project will enable individuals to gain valuable experience in CloudFormation scripting, as well as an understanding of the fundamentals and possibilitys of CloudFormation.
This project aims to demonstrate multiple approaches for connecting different CloudFormation scripts together and the implementation will be extensively explained and commented on to make each step easy to understand.
